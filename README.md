This is the detail summarized information for this project. 

PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

DATA SOURCE
The data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Procedures
1. The run_analysis.R contains the whole procedures how to clean and manipute the original dataset into the final dataset as the requirments below:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. The codebook.md file will indicate the detail explaination of functions and steps used for this project
3. The cleandataset.txt is the final dataset after running the run_analysis.R file
